<h1>Hi I am Yousuf, Welcome to my page!<br/><a href="https://github.com/YDeen03">Aspiring Software Developer, seeking apprenticeship opportunity</a></h1>

-<h2>My Software Development Projects and Skills:</h2>

  - [Christmas Stock System in Python with SQLite commands used, demonstrating database design](https://github.com/YDeen03/Christmas_Shop_system)
    
  - [Python Fighting Game Immortal Combat demonstrating attempted use of Cloud-based gaming and AI Behaviour](https://github.com/YDeen03/ImmortalCombat)
  
  - [Simple Text Based RPG created in College as one of my earliest attempt at Python development](https://github.com/YDeen03/FirstProject_The_Horror_Within)
  
<h2>About me and why I would be an ideal apprentice:</h2>

I am a motivated individual who can adapt to the environment I work to ensure, that will require different skills in which I am capable of learning easily in order for me to push beyond my limits. I am proficient in programming in a variety of languages, mainly Python, SQLite but also including a new curiousity to study other languages such as HTML, Javascript, C# and Haskell 


All my life, I have had such a burning passion and desire for the world of technology and the digital world in general, how our technology and evolved and how it functions ranging from something as simple as a small numerical Casio calculator to something as complex as a large Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, there has been no limits to my passion and sense for discovery and innovation, I love the world we live in due to the many benefits provided by great entrepreneurs and thinkers, I want to be a part of that innovation too and I see this role as not only an opportunity but a favour to myself and the rest of the technological world as we strive to use and improve techonology on a daily basis. Along with my previous studies in education, I know I need to take this burning curiousity further and enhance myself beyond my limits. 


An apprenticeship is a much more appealing way of education for me as it combines the aspects of regular work with learning, an apprenticeship allows me to earn a salary while learning and this can better suit my circumstances. Furthermore, a more hands-on can better enhance my ability to learn and develop my skills and refine any sort of individual weaknesses as well as doing well for the company and working.


<h2>Technological Skills:</h2>

I have learnt from college and my education to code and develop test plans and from my own self teaching, with that making me more proficient in the programming language of Python as well as recently attending bootcamps to learn new languages such as JavaScript and HTML. I have been knowledgeable in the programming language of Python for 3 years, creating my own videogame using Python as a part of my Non-Exam Assessment project and working on client server models for that project itself to allow for the game to be networked. I also learnt database design with SQLite by creating a Christmas shop stock inventory system as a project for college, demonstrating normalised database design with proficiency.  
 

Additionally, in my own spare time I have fixed and repaired tablets and laptops, from screen repairs to soldering jobs and I used to sell those items refurbished on eBay, replacing parts such as the heat sink down to the charging port. One instance was repairing a HP 15 Laptop that was suffering from a charging port issue and dead pixels on the screen I have also have tackle trojan attacks on my family’s computer systems and sucessfully quarantined these threats without data loss, checking the windows registry to ensure no corruption of data and I have been able to reset the BIOS without bricking the HP Stream laptop that was suffering issues. 

Futhermore, I have tackled hardware upgrades previously such as PC components, I upgrade the CPU and GPU but along with that I would upgrade the power supply and fans to avoid any sort of overheating, from a GT 710 to a GT 1030 which are quite low end. Along with hardware upgrades, I have upgraded the software of my devices either by upgrading to Windows 11 from Windows 10 and I have experimented with putting an OS on non native devices, such as Windows 7 on an ARM system which in that case was an android Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite.

With various different knowledge of hardware and software alike, as well as curiousity to try new skills and approaches to my projects and the technology I am benefitting from. I see this as a key quality about myself; that I am willing to try new approaches as well as enhance my skills on previously acquired skills to provide new solutions to more sophiscated problems.


<h2>My interests and hobbies:</h2>

In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym regularly and working out with my friends, I love to play video games from a variety of different genres such as RPGs, fighting games and strategy games and I enjoy socialising with friends and family having that bond with people has also help me meet and enjoy the cpmpany of many more people. 

I also enjoy reading graphic novels and exploring new pieces of hardware and software releasing for different purposes, such as the new AI imaging system called Midjourney and I also appreciate the more older tech such as the Lenovo ThinkPad line for example, as some of the older models especially in the T series that allow for the upgradeability of RAM, M.2 SSD slots for additional storage, Socketed Mobile CPUs which does allow for any CPU upgrades for laptops which is way ahead of its time. The innovation of hardware and software is really complementary to our world and the advancement of not only technology for entertainment but also in our medical technology. 

Neurosurgeons and scientists in Switzerland have come together to create a Bluetooth headband to connect a paralysed man’s brain to his spine with an established wireless connection and have got him to walk again which is extraordinary and just shows why I love technology and how monumental it is to us as an achievement and should always be celebrated. With a flaming passion for what I have been looking to build as a lifelong career, the hobbies and interests I have also correlate to this desire and I believe show my drive and enthusiasm to accomplish what I am looking to achieve which ultimately is to be a proud software developer in a company that is willing to push me to my limits and help me learn to do the best I can for the company.
